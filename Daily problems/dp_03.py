"""
This program calculates the minimum time to wash n loads of clothes in the first task
and calculates the individual weights of three objects in the second task.

    utilize the time, as mentioned in the task, soon as weâ€™ve finished washing load 1 and started hanging the clothes to 
    dry, we can start washing load 2. This means that we have shorten the normal time by 35 minutes per 1 extra load.
    Therefore, if we have n loads, we can shorten 35 minutes times (n-1) loads.
    Other formula: Minimumtime = 60+(Numberofloads-1)*25 where it takes more 25 minutes per each extra load."""
